Backupr
=======

A project of simple backup program. Take it, zip it, send it !

Idea of this project is simple: 

1. Periodically checks a selected directory(ies)

2. If there's a change (new file, updated file, deleted file) it packs the directory content into archive

3. The archive file is sent via FTP to your private server OR copied to cloud folder - your choice.

If you wish to join coding, you are **welcome** to do so!
